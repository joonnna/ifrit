#How to use Ifrit

How to install golang: https://golang.org/doc/install
How to setup golang environment: https://golang.org/doc/code.html

We assume that the user has setup his/her golang environemnt as described in the link above.
With the following directory structure:
golang/src/github.com/

Steps:
1. Create a folder named "joonnna" and place it under the github.com directory.
2. Copy the Ifrit folder from src/ifrit in the hand-in deliverable to the "joonnna" folder. (Directory structure should now be: golang/src/github.com/joonnna/ifrit)
3. Now you can include the library in any golang project with the following statement: 
Client:
import github.com/joonnna/ifrit/client

Certificate authority: 
import github.com/joonnna/ifrit/cauth

An example usage:
package main

import (
	"github.com/joonnna/ifrit/cauth"
	"github.com/joonnna/ifrit/client"	
)

func main() {
	numClients := 10
	numRings := 5

	ca := cauth.NewCa()
	go ca.Start(numRings)

	for i := 0; i < numClients; i++ {
		c := client.NewClient(ca.Addr())
		go c.Start()
	}
}
